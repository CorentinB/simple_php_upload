Simple PHP upload form made with Bootstrap Twitter
==================================================

This is a simple PHP upload form, the design is made with Bootstrap Twitter (http://getbootstrap.com/).

It's a very simple code, it can be used as a base for a more enhanced system.

On the index.php page, you can send a file (max. 2 MB, and only jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp and png, but you can change it in the code.) Once sending is made, you are redirected to a page where he is proposed the link of the image and various ways of integrating it.

It's very simple, with a soft design, but that work well !
